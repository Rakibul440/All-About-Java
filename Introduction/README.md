# The skeleton of a Java program
The skeleton of a Java program includes the essential components that form the structure of any Java application. Let's break it down:

### Key Components of a Basic Java Program:
1. **Class Declaration**: Java programs are built around classes. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Every Java program must have at least one class.
2. **Main Method**: This is the entry point for the program. The program starts execution from here.
3. **Statements/Logic**: Inside the main method, you write the logic or code that the program will execute.

### Structure of a Simple Java Program

```java
// 1. Class Declaration
public class HelloWorld {
    
    // 2. Main Method (entry point of the program)
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // 3. Statements/Logic (code to be executed)
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");  // This prints the message to the console
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Class Declaration (`public class HelloWorld`)**:
   - Every Java program must have at least one class.
   - The `public` keyword means the class is accessible from outside its package (it’s a visibility modifier).
   - `HelloWorld` is the name of the class. You can name it anything, but the class name should start with an uppercase letter by convention.

2. **Main Method (`public static void main(String[] args)`)**:
   - This is the entry point of the Java application. It’s the method that is called when you run the Java program.
   - `public`: The method is public, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere.
   - `static`: You don’t need to create an instance of the class to call the main method. It’s available without creating an object of the class.
   - `void`: The method doesn’t return any value.
   - `String[] args`: This is an array of strings that can be passed from the command line when running the program. For simple programs, this is often unused.

3. **Statements/Logic (`System.out.println("Hello, World!")`)**:
   - Inside the main method, you write the logic you want to execute. In this case, the statement prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
   - `System.out.println()` is a function used to output text to the console.
     - `System`: Refers to the built-in system class.
     - `out`: Refers to the standard output stream (console).
     - `println()`: Prints the specified string followed by a new line.

### Running the Program:
- **Compiling**: To compile this program, save the code in a file named `HelloWorld.java`, then open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your file is saved, and run:
  ```
  javac HelloWorld.java
  ```
  This will create a `HelloWorld.class` file, which is the bytecode version of your program.

- **Running**: To run the compiled program, use:
  ```
  java HelloWorld
  ```

You should see the output:
```
Hello, World!
```

### Example Breakdown:
- **Class**: Contains the structure of the program.
- **Main Method**: This is where the program begins execution.
- **Statements**: Defines the actions the program performs, like printing output to the console.

This basic structure is the skeleton that every Java program follows. You can build more complex programs by adding additional classes, methods, and logic as needed!
